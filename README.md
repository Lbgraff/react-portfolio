# react-portfolio

## Description

My motivation for this project was to build a portfolio for my professional goals. I want to showcase my experience, skills, and project portfolio to future employers. This solves the problem of being an improved portfolio to the one we had built at the beginning of bootcamp. React offers more than just CSS and HTML alone, as before. I learned a lot about React components/pages and how to utilize them with CSS styling.

## Installation

After the user has installed the packages, they can run 'npm run develop' from the command line to launch the application in whatever port they can use. They can also visit the deployed link and explore the website through the navigation bar.

## Usage

See the screenshot below for an example of the styling as well as the content for the Home page.
