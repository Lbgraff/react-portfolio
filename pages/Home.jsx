                <p>I graduated from the University of Texas with a degree in anthropology and a minor in French. After graduation, I
                    was offered a job at Apple translating French for Apple Maps. This was my introduction to the tech world, which
                    prompted me to learn coding. After exploring several other career options, including teaching middle school
                    special ed and working as a professional archaeologist, I have found my way back into coding as something I am
                    interested in as a longterm career. I am very excited about being a student in the UT Coding Boot Camp and enjoy
                    learning more coding skills!
