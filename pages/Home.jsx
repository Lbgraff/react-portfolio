                <p>I graduated from the University of Texas with a degree in anthropology and a minor in French. After graduation, I
                    was offered a job at Apple translating French for Apple Maps. This was my introduction to the tech world, which
                    prompted me to learn coding. I taught middle school special ed for two years during the pandemic. I worked as a professional archaeologist, which was my childhood dream. I have found my way back into coding as a longterm career. I am very excited about coding and have developed a newfound love of computer science. I enjoy learning new coding languages and skills and can't wait to start my career as a programmer.

                <p>I grew up in Omaha, NE until I moved with my family to Austin, TX when I was 13. I have four sisters and no brothers. I enjoy singing, journaling, and spending time with my family and in nature. I speak French semi-fluently and have dabbled in Spanish, German, and Italian. I love learning spoken languages as much as I love learning coding ones!
